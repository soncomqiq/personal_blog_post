Interior enhancements include a new eight-inch rear display for infotainment and climate control, ventilated front seats, higher quality materials, acoustic glass and customizable ambient lighting.  Exterior modifications include integrated fog lights and indicators in the main headlights, a front design optimized for aerodynamics, and connected rear lights. Two new color options have been introduced: Ultra Red and Stealth Grey. The vehicle comes in two variants: the Real Wheel Model 3 with a 272-mile range and the Long Range Model 3, now offering a slightly increased EPA estimated range of 341 miles. Model 3 Highland is not eligible for the IRA tax credit, making it comparatively more expensive than the Model Y. The Performance trim of Model 3 is still in development, and the older version is no longer available for order. However, existing stock can be purchased with a minimum $5,000 discount, plus the applicable IRA tax credit.',

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?',
